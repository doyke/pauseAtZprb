# pauseAtZprb
A [Cura](http://wiki.ultimaker.com/Cura) plugin to pause the printer at a given height for a given length of time.

##The original pauseAtZ
The [original pauseAtZ plugin](http://wiki.ultimaker.com/CuraPlugin:_Pauseatz) was written by David Braam but seems to be designed for printers with buttons to resume the print after the pause. This is a slight modification of that plugin designed for printers without such buttons (such as [printrbot](http://printrbot.com/)), instead of pausing until the user prompts the priter to resume it will remain still for a given length of time.
